# Animal-Table - Web Application

# Project Overview

This project is a web-based application that dynamically renders three interactive tables displaying information about Big Cats, Dogs, and Big Fish. Each table provides unique functionalities such as sorting, data entry, validation, deletion, and editing. The project is built using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and JavaScript/TypeScript following object-oriented programming principles.
